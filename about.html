	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm Joey Jiron and welcome to my food blog. Here I try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post feel free to leave a comment.</p>
	<p>I grew up in Los Angeles, California and grew up eating the most delicious Mexican food made by my mom. She is my inspiration and I hope to be as good as her one day.</p>
