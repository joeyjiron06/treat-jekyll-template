    1. Season your fish with the rub and let it brine for 2hrs or overnight. The
    longer the better

    2. Peel the corn husks back but not all the way off. Remove the hair for the
    corn. Soak the corn in water. This helps steam the corn when on the BBQ.

    3. Start your smoker

    4. Smoke the fish until it reaches the temperature of 145&deg;F

    5. Parboil the artichokes ~5min in boiling water

    6. Take the coals from the smoker and put them in the BBQ pit.

    7. Grill the corn and artichokes

    8. Melt some butter in a small pan with some butter on a low heat (donâ€™t
    burn the butter). &nbsp;Add garlic and the juice of a lemon. Optionally add
    some chopped parsley.

    9. When the corn and artichokes are done, add the flavored butter all over
    them

    10. Now your ready to eat\!
