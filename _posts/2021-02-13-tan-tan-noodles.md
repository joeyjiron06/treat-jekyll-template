    1. Start boiling water for the noodles and cook noodles until desired
    firmness.

    2. Drain tofu of as much water as you can get out.

    3. Fry tofu on medium heat for 20-30 mins and break apart so that it looks
    like ground pork (or use ground pork to make it non-vegan).

    4. Once tofu is nice and crispy add paprika, chinese 5 spice, sichuan pepper
    corn and saute for 1 minute. Add soy sauce to give the tofu some more color
    and remove from the heat.

    5. Boil some green beans until slightly tender then drain and add chili if
    you want more heat. Chop up green beans into 1 inch length pieces.

    6. To serve add hot chili oil to a bowl, noodles, diced green onions, and
    green beans.

[Dandan noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandan_noodles){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;are an amazing recipe from Sichuan, China where the food is really spicy. If you like spice then this is definitely a dish for you\! I love this dish when I'm craving noodles. This is a vegan dish, but you can substitute the tofu for any protein you like such as ground pork or ground beef.

Sichuan peppercorns give this dish a numbing sensation to your tongue, so don't be alarmed if your tongue feels numb. The ingredients on this list are best found at your local asian grocery store, but can also be found online.
