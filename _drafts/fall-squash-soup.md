# Fall Squash Soup

This soup is great during the cold fall months when the leaves are falling and thanksgiving is around the corner. This recipe is great because you can make it vegan, or you can make it for thanksgiving and add turkey stock instead of veggie stock.

I use my Instant Pot for this and it is so much faster and easier to make. You can of course use a pressure cooker and if you donâ€™t have one, then you can bake the squash, sweet potato, and carrot instead.
