    it to a medium flame pan with oil.

    meat.

    3. Right before the tofu is done add paprika and soy sauce for color. Then
    take the tofu out of the pan.

    4. Add garlic, ginger, and chilis to the pan and cook until oils is infused
    with the ingredients. Then add some brown sugar to caramelize the
    ingredients.

    5. Add the tofu back in the pan and top off with some diced green onions and
    lime zest. Then take off the heat.

    6. Prepare the sauce by combining soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil, olive
    oil, fish sauce (optional), brown sugar, and cilantro in a small serving
    bowl.

    7. Serve lettuce wraps by adding tofu mixture in lettuce leaves and serve
    the sauce on the side as a dipping sauce.

These are perfect when you are craving Thai food and something light to eat. These wraps are inspired by my favorite chef ever, Gordon Ramsay\! He does his wraps with ground beef, but I really like them with tofu
